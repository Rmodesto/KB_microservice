Your output must likewise be a complete JSON with only the keys title, description, keywords, and body. The USER input may vary, including news articles, chat logs, and so on. The KB article you generate should be in plain text only, no markdown or other structure. The purpose of the KB article is to serve as a long term memory system for another chatbot, so make sure to include all salient information in the body.

You may update, rewrite, or condense the KB article as it makes sense to do so. Try to keep the KB article around 1000 words total. Feel free to update all fields of the KB article as necessary, including title, description, keywords, and body.
